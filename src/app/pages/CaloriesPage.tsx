    // ── Macros & Nutrition ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    protein:    `Protein is essential for muscle repair, satiety, and metabolism. For a ${goal} kcal diet, aim for 120–150g of protein/day (25–30% of calories). High-protein foods: chicken breast (~165 kcal/100g, 31g protein), eggs (~70 kcal each, 6g protein), Greek yogurt (~130 kcal, 17g protein).`,
    carbs:      `Carbohydrates are your body's primary energy source. On a ${goal} kcal diet, 45–55% from carbs means roughly 248–303g/day. Focus on complex carbs — oats, brown rice, sweet potato — for sustained energy rather than spikes.`,
    carbohydrates: `Carbs supply quick energy and support brain function. Aim for 45–55% of your calories (${Math.round(goal * 0.5 / 4)}g/day approx). Prioritize whole grains, legumes, and vegetables over refined sugars and white bread.`,
    fat:        `Dietary fat is crucial for hormones, brain health, and fat-soluble vitamin absorption. Aim for 20–35% of your daily calories (~49–85g/day on a ${goal} kcal goal). Prioritize healthy fats — avocado, nuts, olive oil, fatty fish.`,
    fibre:      `Fibre aids digestion, controls blood sugar, and keeps you full longer — critical for calorie management. Aim for 25–38g/day. Top sources: lentils, black beans, broccoli, oats, chia seeds, and apples with skin.`,
    fiber:      `Dietary fibre (target 25–38g/day) helps you feel full on fewer calories — a major advantage for staying within your ${goal} kcal goal. It also feeds beneficial gut bacteria and slows sugar absorption.`,
    sugar:      `Added sugar adds calories with minimal nutritional value. The WHO recommends under 50g/day (ideally under 25g). Watch hidden sugars in sauces, drinks, flavoured yogurts, and packaged snacks — they add up fast.`,
    sodium:     `Sodium doesn't add calories but affects water retention and blood pressure. Aim for under 2,300 mg/day. High-sodium foods: processed meats, canned soups, fast food, and soy sauce. Drinking more water helps flush excess sodium.`,
    macro:      `Your key macronutrient targets on a ${goal} kcal diet: Protein ~30% (150g) · Carbs ~45% (248g) · Fat ~25% (61g). Tracking macros alongside calories gives you a clearer picture of food quality, not just quantity.`,
    macros:     `Macro split for a ${goal} kcal goal: ~150g protein (600 kcal) · ~248g carbohydrates (990g kcal) · ~68g fat (610 kcal). These are estimates — your ideal ratios depend on your activity level and fitness goals.`,
    nutrition:  `Good nutrition goes beyond calories. Ensure you're getting: sufficient protein for muscle and satiety, complex carbs for energy, healthy fats for hormones, and plenty of fibre and micronutrients from vegetables and whole foods.`,

    // ── Weight & Body Composition ─────────────────────────────────────────────
    weight:     `To lose ~0.5 kg/week, you need a ~500 kcal daily deficit. To gain muscle, aim for a 200–300 kcal surplus. Your current goal of ${goal} kcal/day is your maintenance or target level — consistency over weeks is what drives results.`,
    lose:       `Safe weight loss is 0.25–1 kg/week — achieved by a 250–1000 kcal daily deficit. At your ${goal} kcal goal, if your maintenance is ~2400 kcal, you're already in a gentle deficit. Pair this with strength training to preserve muscle mass.`,
    gain:       `To gain muscle or weight, eat in a 200–500 kcal surplus above your maintenance. Prioritise protein (1.6–2.2g/kg bodyweight) and resistance training. A slow bulk of 0.25–0.5 kg/week minimises fat gain.`,
    maintain:   `Weight maintenance happens when calories in ≈ calories out. Your ${goal} kcal goal is designed for this balance. Daily fluctuations are normal — focus on weekly averages rather than stressing about single days.`,
    deficit:    `A calorie deficit means eating fewer calories than you burn. A 500 kcal/day deficit produces ~0.5 kg/week of fat loss. ${isOver ? `Today you're in a surplus of ${overBy} kcal, so no deficit today.` : `You've eaten ${totalCals} kcal — if your maintenance is above this, you're in a deficit today.`}`,
    surplus:    `A calorie surplus means eating more than you burn. ${isOver ? `Today you're ${overBy} kcal above your ${goal} kcal goal.` : `You're not in surplus yet — ${remaining} kcal remaining in your budget.`} Small surpluses support muscle building; large surpluses lead to fat gain.`,
    metabolism: `Metabolism determines how many calories you burn at rest (BMR). Average BMR is ~1400–1800 kcal/day. Total daily burn (TDEE) adds activity: lightly active people burn ~1.3–1.5x BMR. Your ${goal} kcal goal likely reflects your estimated TDEE.`,
    bmi:        `BMI (Body Mass Index) is calculated from height and weight, not calories. It's a rough health indicator. More useful for nutrition goals: focus on body composition — muscle vs. fat ratio — which consistent calorie logging and resistance training help optimize.`,

    // ── Weekly Trends & Stats ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
    week:       `Your 7-day calorie data: Mon 1,980 · Tue 2,150 · Wed 2,320 · Thu 1,890 · Fri 2,100 · Sat 2,450 · Today ${totalCals}. Weekly average: ~${Math.round((1980+2150+2320+1890+2100+2450+totalCals)/7)} kcal/day vs your ${goal} kcal goal.`,

    trend:      `Your calorie trend this week shows moderate variation — a low of 1,890 kcal and a high of 2,450 kcal. Aim to keep all days within ±200 kcal of your ${goal} kcal goal for the most stable energy and body composition results.`,
    average:    `Your 7-day calorie average is ~${Math.round((1980+2150+2320+1890+2100+2450+totalCals)/7)} kcal/day. Your daily goal is ${goal} kcal. The weekly average is a much stronger predictor of long-term results than any single day's intake.`,

    chart:      `The 7-day bar chart shows your calorie intake per day. Today's bar (highlighted in orange) currently shows ${totalCals} kcal. The chart updates in real time as you log more meals today.`,
    stats:      `Your calorie stats: Today ${totalCals} kcal · Goal ${goal} kcal · ${Math.round(pct)}% complete · ${meals.length} meals logged · ${mealAvg > 0 ? `${mealAvg} kcal/meal avg` : 'No meals yet'} · 6-day streak · 7-day avg ~${Math.round((1980+2150+2320+1890+2100+2450+totalCals)/7)} kcal.`,
    data:       `Nutrition data for today: ${totalCals} kcal consumed · ${goal} kcal goal · ${Math.round(pct)}% progress · ${meals.length} items logged · ${remaining > 0 ? remaining + ' kcal remaining' : overBy + ' kcal over goal'}.`,

    // ── Meal Types & Timing ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
    preworkout: `Pre-workout meals should be eaten 1–3 hrs before training. Aim for 200–400 kcal with a balance of carbs and protein: banana + peanut butter (~280 kcal), oats + milk (~300 kcal), or a protein smoothie (~350 kcal). This fuels performance without causing discomfort.`,
    postworkout:`Post-workout nutrition is critical for recovery. Within 30–60 mins of training, aim for 300–500 kcal with high protein (25–40g) and moderate carbs to replenish glycogen. Options: protein shake + banana (~350 kcal), chicken + rice (~450 kcal), or Greek yogurt + berries (~250 kcal).`,
    timing:     `Meal timing affects energy and appetite. A common approach: Breakfast 7–9 AM · Snack 10:30 AM · Lunch 12–1 PM · Snack 3:30 PM · Dinner 6–8 PM. Eating every 3–4 hrs prevents excessive hunger that leads to overeating.`,
    fasting:    `Intermittent fasting (IF) compresses your eating window — commonly 16:8 (eat within 8 hrs, fast 16 hrs). It doesn't require eating less, just eating within a window. Some people find it easier to hit calorie goals within a defined window. Still log all meals for accuracy.`,
    eating:     `Mindful eating — eating slowly, without distractions, and stopping at 80% full — naturally reduces calorie intake by 10–20% without counting. Pair it with logging for the most powerful results. You've eaten ${totalCals} kcal today.`,

    // ── Tips & Advice ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    tips:       `Top calorie management tips: ① Log every meal — even snacks. ② Fill half your plate with vegetables (low-cal, high-fibre). ③ Drink water before meals to reduce hunger. ④ Avoid liquid calories (juice, soda, alcohol). ⑤ Meal prep to avoid impulse eating.`,
    advice:     `Based on your data: you're at ${totalCals} kcal today. ${isOver ? `You've exceeded your goal — consider a light, protein-rich dinner tonight and prioritise vegetables.` : `You're doing well. Focus on protein and vegetables for your remaining ${remaining} kcal to stay satisfied.`}`,
    help:       `I can help you with: calorie totals, daily & weekly trends, macro guidance, meal timing, weight goals, food tips, and logging meals. Try asking about your progress, macros, a specific meal type, or what to eat next!`,
    hungry:     `Feeling hungry with ${remaining > 0 ? remaining + ' kcal remaining' : 'your goal reached'}? ${remaining > 300 ? `You have room for a satisfying meal — choose high-protein and high-fibre options to stay full longer.` : `Try high-volume, low-calorie foods: cucumber, celery, leafy greens, or a broth-based soup. Drinking a large glass of water first can also reduce perceived hunger.`}`,
    full:       `Feeling full is a great sign of portion control! Your satiety hormones (leptin and ghrelin) work best when meals are eaten slowly and you stop before feeling stuffed. You've consumed ${totalCals} kcal today — ${isOver ? 'slightly over goal.' : 'still within your budget.'}`,
    water:      `Hydration is often confused with hunger — if you feel hungry soon after eating, try drinking 250–500 ml of water first. Aim for 2–3 litres/day. Water has zero calories and helps your body metabolize fat more efficiently.`,
    improve:    `To improve your nutrition: ① Increase protein to 1.6–2g/kg body weight. ② Replace refined carbs with whole grains. ③ Eat more vegetables (aim for 5+ servings/day). ④ Log everything — even condiments and drinks. ⑤ Meal prep 2–3 days ahead to avoid poor choices.`,
    cheat:      `One higher-calorie day won't derail your progress — it takes a 3,500 kcal surplus to gain 0.5 kg of fat. What matters is the weekly average. After a higher day, simply return to your ${goal} kcal target the next day without over-restricting.`,
